## Our Goals for this Project

Our goal for this project was to examine how we could leverage machine learning in the financial markets to augment our trading performance.

We looked to answer whether our "machine" could perform better than individual stocks within specific ETFs. Additionally, we looked to answer whether we could use various clustering methods to group individual stocks together better than ETFs currently trading in the marketplace.


## Data Gathering, Cleanup, and API Selection

The first step for us to begin our project was to find historical stock information including a number of key metrics that would be used for both the clustering analysis and in building the machine learning model. We determined that metrics such as EBITDA, total debt, net income, VWAP, moving averages, etc. would be critical for us to perform our analysis.

Through various APIs and online resouces we were able to gather a data set of over 160 individual stocks inclduing the metrics mentioned above. 

APIs used:

* Alpaca 
* IEX 

Online Resources used:

* Bloomberg
* Medium
* Github
